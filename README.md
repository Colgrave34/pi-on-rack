#### Just like the name, this is a Raspberry Pi rack mount. 
I specifically built for Raspberry Pi 4 with official PoE HAT. It should work fine with Raspberry Pi 3b+ with PoE HAT.  
I use m2.5 hex standoffs (m2.5_4+4)  
The standoffs should be screw between the bottom PCB and the piece with the screws that come with PoE HAT.

I used Blender for this project. And used [Boolean](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/modifiers/generate/booleans.html) to cut out the holes.  
  
I have plans for dual mount, right-mount and full 1U mount, please look forward to it!
